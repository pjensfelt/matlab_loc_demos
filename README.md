# matlab_loc_demos
Demos of EKF and PF developed for demos during lectures

There are four point landmarks which you can turn on/off. You can control the measurement noise model and you can move the platform around using commands v,w, adjusted by a slider.



## EKF
EKF.m

This is the main program to use to play around with Extended Kalman filter based localization. 

### Pure prediction
In this first test we will look at how the uncertainty of the robot increases when we move through the environment

#### Preparation
* Make sure that the landmarks are deactivated (L1-L4 are not "pushed")



## Monte Cralo Localization
